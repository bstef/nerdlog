## TODO

- During bootstrap, don't overwrite file if it's up to date
- Use some user-specific name for the resident bash file
  /var/tmp/query_logs.sh, so that multiple users won't be overwriting the same
  file

- Implement configs, since locally I need jumphost but on worker I don't, and also
  right now all nodes are hardcoded
- In config, instead of Hostname+Port, use Addr: this way there will be no confusion
  between "host name" and "hostname"
