## TODO

- During bootstrap, don't overwrite file if it's up to date
- Use some user-specific name for the resident bash file
  /var/tmp/query_logs.sh, so that multiple users won't be overwriting the same
  file

- Implement configs, since locally I need jumphost but on worker I don't, and also
  right now all nodes are hardcoded

- Statusline: (green) * 21 (orange) * 3 (red) * 0 . When number is non-zero,
  font is bold.
- Searching and highlighting can be implemented using color tags like [:red]foo[:-]

### Super important

- Config (and have one ready with all our hosts)
- When logs are being reloaded, clear table first
- On startup, have some state like "connecting" and don't panic if a query is
  made. Also, query 1h right away
